Prerequisites:
Python Installed: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website. During installation, ensure you check the option that says "Add Python to PATH."
Running the Scripts:
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:

Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd or powershell, and press Enter.
Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type terminal, and press Enter.
Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T or use your preferred method to open the terminal.
Navigate to the Directory Where Scripts are Located:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python scripts are located. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/repository/folder
Run the Script:

To run a script, type python script_name.py in the terminal and press Enter. Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run. For example:
arduino
Copy code
python shutdown.py
If you're using Python 3, you might need to use python3 instead of python:

arduino
Copy code
python3 shutdown.py
The script will execute, and if it requires any user input (like the shutdown script, which asks for confirmation), provide the necessary input when prompted.

Remember, these scripts perform actions like shutting down or restarting your computer. Make sure to save any important work before running them, especially the shutdown and restart scripts, as they will perform the actions immediately after you execute the command.
